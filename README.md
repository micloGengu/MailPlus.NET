# MailPlus.NET
The [MailPlus REST API](https://api.mailplus.nl/doc/) allows you to interact with your MailPlus account, giving you the opportunity to interact directly with objects such as contacts, mailings and form requests.

The MailPlus REST API uses [OAuth 1.0a (One Leg)](http://oauthbible.com/#oauth-10a-one-legged). A consumer key and secret are required to access your MailPlus account. These can be created in your [MailPlus account](https://login.mailplus.nl/).

## Getting started
Install the NuGet package from the Package Manager Console:
```powershell
Install-Package MailPlus.NET
```

In your application, call:

```cs
MailPlusClient client = new MailPlusClient(new OAuth1HmacSha1HttpMessageHandler()
{
	ConsumerKey = "",
	ConsumerSecret = ""
});
client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
```

## AutoRest
All source code is generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) from the included `swagger.json` file. After editing the file, the source code can be updated by running the following command from the Package Manager Console:

```powershell
AutoRest -Input swagger.json -Namespace MailPlus -OutputDirectory MailPlus -ClientName MailPlusClient
```
